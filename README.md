## Description 
I have created Gleaner to build an API of plants and their medicinal uses. I have known many people who love to use plants as medicine and I was thinking of them while I built this.

## The Site

## Next Steps 
I'd like to add a coulple of more features with authorization. For example I'd like a user to only delete a plant made by them and which user made what comment. I'd like to make the API public once more plants are added. I would like to give plants more than one photo that a user could scroll through.
